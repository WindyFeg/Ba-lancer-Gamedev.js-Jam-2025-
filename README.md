# Ba-lancer
This game is another one from 268LTK. this game is all about balance stats from our player and enemy.

This demo version implements the very basics of our initial idea. It showcases the trade-offs you need to make to achieve stat A and the corresponding trade-offs for stat B, as you try to balance everything in your favor. Due to the limitations of our team with 3D game development and our limited time, this 2D-3D art style represents our best efforts. We kindly ask you not to judge it harshly and hope you have fun. Thank you.

- Controls: WASD to move.
- Click Player/Enemy to adjust stats. Press again on that target to exits
